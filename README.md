# Hello World with AR.js

## Synopsis 
My first step into the world of web AR via [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js).

## Motivation
I'm very interest in learning more in the AR/VR field as that's what sparked my passion for learning to code.

## Getting Started
To view go to this repo's github pages [link](https://julessep.github.io/AR.js-hello-world/), allow camera and hold the [Hiro marker](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg) in the frame.
